# Generators

Commonly used generators such as oscillators, phasor (i.e. positive sawtooth)
and others. This list will grow a bit over time.

[`oscil`](@ref) is sine wave oscillator, [`phasor`](@ref) is a sawtooth
wave that can also be used as a periodic phase signal, [`noise`](@ref) is
white noise and [`sample`](@ref) plays back a "sample".
