# For music

A "Gen" has a method to implement which has the signature - 

`proc(::Gen, ::Bus, t::Float64) -> Tuple{Float64,Gen}`

The `proc` method is expected to schedule any signals to the bus
using `sched(::Bus,t,::Signal)` and return info about the next
gen to trigger later. The `t` argument to `proc` is "clock time" and
not real time - i.e. it is determined by the clock which the bus
runs.
